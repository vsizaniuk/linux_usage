grep -A3 amy /etc/passwd = shows matching and 3 following lines 
grep -B3 amy /etc/passwd = shows matching line and 3 lines before it 
egrep = *extended regular expression support

find / -name "hosts" = will list up all files named exactly hosts the under root directory 
find / -user uname = will list up all files created by uname under the root directory 
find / -size +100M = will list up all files those size > 100 megabytes
find / -size +100M 2>/dev/null = as previous, but error output will be redirected to /dev/null
mkdir /root/uname; find / -user uname -exec cp {} /root/uname \; = will make a backup for all files created by uname 
find / -type f -size +100M = will list up all files bigger than 100 megabytes
find /etc -exec grep -l amy {} \; 2>/dev/null = will find all objects containing amy in file names in the /etc directory
find /etc -name '*' -type f | xargs grep "127.0.0.1" = will find all files that contains text 127.0.0.1 in the /etc directory
