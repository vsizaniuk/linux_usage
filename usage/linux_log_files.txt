# reading logs
overview:
    - syslog is a legacy service that takes care of logging (old syslog, syslog-ng and rsyslog)
    - systemd-journald is a system-integrated log service

journalctl = shows the complete journal
journalctl -u <unit> = shows information about specific unit (uses tab completion)
journalctl --dmesg = shows kernel messages
journalcrl -u crond --since yesterday --until 9:00 -p info = shows crond messages for a period of time

rsyslog service works with facility, priority and destination
    - facility is what rsyslog should be logging for
    - priority indicates the severity of a log event
    - destination defines where a message should be written to
    - /etc/rsyslog.conf is a main configuration file (here log rules are defined)
    - /etc/rsyslog.d/ is a snap in directory

/var/log/messages - usually, the most important log file in linux system 
logger {message} = send message directly to /var/log/messages
