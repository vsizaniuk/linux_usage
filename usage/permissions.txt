# ugo - user - group - others: ownership

chgrp {group} {object} = change group owner

- permissions meaning matrix

  | file   | dir
r | open   | list
w | modify | create/delete
e | run    | cd

- object permissions matrix

      |     sp     | user owner | group owner | others
r = 4 | suid = 4   |     4      |     4       |   4
w = 2 | sgid = 2   |     2      |     2       |
e = 1 | sticky = 1 |     1      |     1       |
                         7            7           4
- this example means that user and group owner have full rights on an object, others can only read


chmod {rel or abs mode def} {object} = can change ugo rights on a particular object
chmod 777 test_file = everyone can do anything, absolute mode
chmod g+w test_file = grants write to group, relative mode

- special permissions meaning matrix

           | file               | dir
suid = 4   | run as owner       |  -
sgid = 2   | run as group owner | inherit directory group owner
sticky = 1 |         -          | delete if you are owner


- in order to manage special permissions you need to add additional specification to chmod mode

chmod 4770 object = modifies object's special permissions, as left-leading "4" is specified
chmod u+s file   = grants suid on an object
chmod g+s object = grants sgid on an object
chmod +t dir = grants sticky bit on a directory

# default permissions

- default permissions on directories are 777
- default permissions on files are 666

umask = allows subtracting default permissions (shell configuration)

umask 022 = will set default files permissions to 644, dir to 755
umask 027 = will set default files permissions to 640, dir to 750
