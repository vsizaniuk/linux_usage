# networking, IPv4, IPv6

IP = internet protocol
IPv4 = older version of the IP

addresses are 32 bytes

example IP = 192.168.0.28/24

| net. a.  | n. | subnet mask
 192.168.0.  28   /24

net. a. = network address (this case, first 24 bytes)
n. = node address (this case, last 8 bytes)
subnet mask = mask that points to network address
in order to point to port : is used = 192.168.0.28:1521

Router = device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks.
example router IP = 192.168.0.254
Router is a default gate away to any other network

DNS = domain name system

IPv6 = newer version of the IP

addresses are 128 bits and written in hexadecimal
example IPv6 IP = fe80::a00:27ff:fe30:c8b2
columns are used to split 16 bits parts of it
leading zeros can be omitted as well as long string zeros
fe80::1 is a valid IPv6 address
in order to point a port [] are used - [fe80::1]:80
default subnet mask is 64 bits
node bit of the address may contain the device MAC address

reserved IPv6 addresses:

::1/128 is a localhost = 127.0.0.1 IPv4
:: or ::/0 is an unspecified IP = 0.0.0.0 IPv4
2000::/3 is a global unicast address = worldwide unique registered adderesses are starting with anything from this range
fd00::/8 is a unique local address = private address for internal use only; routable
fe80::/64 is a link local address = nonroutable address that makes sure that every interface is an IPv6 address
ff00::/8 is a multicast address = group address that allows devices to communicate to specific group of devices

fe80:: is used by default

ip a = showing current network configuration; shows network devices
ip addr show = ip a
LO = loopback = is the internal IP stack; interface exists for historical reasons

MAC address = unique identifier on the network card
inet = IPv4 address
inet6 = IPv6 address

ip route show = showing routing configuration, including default gateway
cat /etc/resolv.conf = contain the IP address of the DNS name server

ping {address} = checking if address is available

ways to broke network:
    - comment DNS pointer in /etc/resolv.conf -> Name or service not known
    - ip route del default via {IP address} -> Network is unreachable; fix = ip route add default via {IP address}
    - ip addr del dev {device} {IP address} -> Name or service not known; fix = dhclient or ip addr add (a a can be used) dev {device} {IP address}

Network device naming (biosdevname)
biosdevname = uses device name that reveal information about physical location and \
              system-udevd generates the network device names

    - em123 = Ethernet Motherboard Portnumber
    - p<port>p<slot> = (PCI, PCI port); PCI = Peripheral Component Interconnect
    - eno123 = (EtherNet Onboard)
    - if driver doesn't reveal sufficient information, eth0 etc. is used

hostname = shows host name (FQDM Fully Qualified Domain Name)
hostname -I = shows IPv4 addresses linked to the hostname
hostnamectl = allows to control the hostname
hostnamectl status = shows information about the host and machine

configuring host names in /etc/hosts may be convenient for internal purposes in order to not configure DNS server
in /etc/nsswitch.conf the hostname search order can be redefined (f.e. files dbs myhostname)

# network utility commands

ping {DNS name or IP address} = pings an address and checks if its up
ping -f {DNS name or IP address} = sends a ping flood
ping -f -s 4096 {DNS name or IP address} = putting a ping bomb on a machine
netstat - tulpen = shows everything that is listening on this machine
ss -tuna = socket stats, more or less is a netstat -tulpen in modern way
nmap = tool to perform an advance network scan
nmap {IP address} = list of the all open ports that are discovered
dig {DNS name} = retrieve information about specific DNS name
