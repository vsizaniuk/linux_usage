#
hardware time  --> system time <---> NTP (network time protocol)

- system time commands
    date
    time
    datectl
- hardware time commands
    hwtime
    hwclock

date = shows the current system time
date -s [ISO datetime] = allows setting the time
hwclock -s = set the system time from hardware clock
hwclock -w = set the hardware clock from system time
timedatectl = allows managing time and timezones

NTP servers have got stratum 1-16 that is a measurement of server reliability
1 (atomic clock) --> 2 --> 3 .... --> 16 (time errors contain)

timedatectl status = shows the system datetime configuration
chronyc sources = shows NTP servers information
ntpdate = allows setting datetime from NTP
ntpq = allows querying ntp

insane clock - a situation when the system time is to far from NTP server time, it may require adjusting system time before using ntpdate
