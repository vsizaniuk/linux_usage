# systemd
is the manager of everything
first thing that is started after starting the Linux kernel
it starts processes and can do it in parallel
manages mounts, timers, paths and much more
it is events driven
man includes a specification for every unit type that can be used

Items that are managed by systemd are called units
Default units are in /usr/lib/systemd/system, custom units are in /etc/systemd
custom unit > default unit

systemctl = command line systemd manager
systemctl -t help = shows unit types
systemctl list-unit-files = lists all installed units
systemctl list-units = lists active units
systemctl enable {name.service}
systemctl start {name.service}
systemctl disable {name.service}
systemctl stop {name.service}
systemctl status {name.service}
systemctl cat {name.service} = shows current unit configuration
systemctl show {name.service} = shows all available configuration parameters
systemctl edit {name.service} = allows editing service configuration
systemctl deamon-reload = reloads service configuration
systemctl restart {name.service} = restarts the service

# target
is a group of services
some targets are isolatable witch means that you can use them as a state your system should be in
    - emergency.target
    - resque.target
    - multi-user.target
    - graphical.target

systemctl list-dependencies name.target = shows the content and dependencies of name.target
systemctl start name.target = starts a target
systemctl isolate name.target = switches system to another target
systemctl get-default = shows default name.target
systemctl set-default name.target = sets default name.target
